# Indexed Map

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/djhaskin987/indexed-map.png)](https://travis-ci.org/djhaskin987/indexed-map)

A Clojure library that provides the indexed-map, a set which allows retrieval and
removal from a sorted map using the index of the element in logarithmic time.
It is generic enough for wide use, but also contains the functionality needed to implement
a ranked set, which I discuss [here](http://djhaskin987.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-rankedset-optimizations-best-friend.html).

## Download

You can download the jar or zip from the github release page. This project is also on [clojars](https://clojars.org/indexed-map)!

## Build

Simply run `lein jar` to get the jar file.

## Usage

This map implements the `clojure.lang.IPersistentMap` protocol, as well as the `clojure.lang.Indexed` protocol.
One additional function, `disjoin-nth`, is implemented, which takes an index associated with a
key/value pair in the map and removes that pair.

## How Can I Help?

* Some examples in this README.md would be _great_ :smile:
* Pull requests of all shapes and sizes! Keep in mind, we use the orthodox [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model here, with the provision that I'll accept a pull request to any branch except `master`. If a you want to open a pull request for the next release, please do it against `develop`.

### Roadmap
_Things That Would Be Good_

* Split the `balance` method into `lbalance` and `rbalance` for optimization purposes
* Docstring for the disjoin-nth method
* Implement a smarter `seq` implementation, one that would take `O(log(n))` time for any operation
* Benchmarks, profiles and improvements!

## Attribution
_People Whose Ideas I Stole_

Matt Might has a [_great_ article](http://matt.might.net/articles/red-black-delete/)
on how to perform functional red-black tree removal, without which this would
be a much lesser data structure.

The [Clojure Cookbook's article on red black trees](https://github.com/clojure-cookbook/clojure-cookbook/blob/master/02_composite-data/2-27_and_2-28_custom-data-structures/2-27_red-black-trees-part-i.asciidoc#sec_red_black_part_ii) was invaluable in making this data structure.

Chris Okasaki's _Functional Data Structures_, Chapter 2, is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn red-black trees.

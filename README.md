# random-access-map

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/djhaskin987/random-access-map.png)](https://travis-ci.org/djhaskin987/random-access-map)

A Clojure library provides the random-access-map, a set which allows you to retreive
and cut elements from the set based on the magnitude of their rank.

## Attribution
_People whose ideas I stole_

Matt Might has a [_great_ article](http://matt.might.net/articles/red-black-delete/)
on how to perform functional red-black tree removal, without which this would
be a much lesser data structure.
